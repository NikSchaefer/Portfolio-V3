## What is Django?

Django is an open source python web framework. Django is foremost a backend
framework and works well to create a site.

## What is a rest API?

Most websites use some sort of a rest API. If you are looking to integrate react
or another framework with Django you would most likely use a rest framework.

A rest framework displays data in a server on the web. typically in a JSON
format. A frontend of a site will typically make an API call to the site and the
server will send back the data.

## Skip the setup

I have created a Django API template that is configured for easy deployment with
heroku. The template includes React with Typescript configuration with webpack.

Find the template here then skip to Models Below

## Setting up a Rest API

You need to create an app in Django for the framework.

install Django https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/install/

First create the project in terminal

```
django-admin startproject mysite
```

Then create the app

```
python manage.py startapp api
```

This creates another app in the project

while we are in terminal lets install the rest framework

```
pip install rest_framework
```

To start your app

```
python manage.py runserver
```

in settings.py under installed apps add the api

```py
INSTALLED_APPS = [
 ...
 'api',
 'rest_framework'
]
```

in urls.py in the primary folder make sure to include api.urls like this

```py
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('api/', include('api.urls')),
]
```

## Models

In the API folder in models.py create a model to fit your data you want to
display.

```py
class Article(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=30, default='')
    body = models.TextField(default='')
    date = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    author = models.CharField(max_length=30, default='')

 def __str__(self):
     return self.title
```

## Serializers

In the rest framework in order to display the data you need to create a
serializers for your models. This basically selects the fields of the model you
want to display

here we are selecting all the fields

If there is no serializer file in your api folder create the file

```py
from rest_framework import serializers
from .models import Article

class ArticleSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
 class Meta:
        model = Article
        fields = '__all__'
```

This selects all the fields, we will import the serialzer in views.py

## Views

in views.py or where your views are

this creates the render for the model

```py
from rest_framework import generics
from .models import Article
from .serializers import ArticleSerializer

class ArticleView(generics.ListAPIView):
    queryset = Article.objects.all()
    serializer_class = ArticleSerializer
```

## URLs

in the urls.py file you need to reference your views to display them

```py

from .views import ArticeView
from django.urls import path

urlpatterns = [
    path("article", ArticeView),
]
```

Now your API is complete, if you run the server you can find the article at

```
127.0.0.1:8000/api/article
```

if 127.0.0.1:8000 is the server port

to return as JSON add a ?format=json to the api requeset

```
127.0.0.1:8000/api/article?format=json
```

Now add to your models and retrieve your data by calling to that server!
