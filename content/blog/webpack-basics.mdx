## What is webpack?

Webpack is a static module loader that compiles your scripts into a bundle
script you can load at the bottom of your html. This makes your scripts more
efficient and smaller.

## Why use webpack?

Webpack makes your scripts smaller more efficient into a bundle script. This can
decrease your initial file load size. React and major frameworks will
automatically compile your scripts but using webpack gives you more control over
your scripts and a base understanding of how frameworks work under the hood.

## Basics

Webpack is built for JavaScript

the config file name is

## webpack.config.js

which means that webpack file is in JavaScript

webpack follows es5 JavaScript

the basic layout is contained in a

`module.exports = {}` All the info for webpack is inside the exports

## Entry File

`entry: "./src/index.js"` this is the primary file for input but you can also
use an array of many files

## Target

target: "web" The target is typically web but it depends what you are looking
for in the script bundle

## Mode and Output

```js
 mode: "development",
 output: {
 path: "./build/js",
 filename: "main.js",
},
```

Mode is for what you are currently doing with it. development will be less
optimized but compile faster for development

The output is where the output file will be.

filename is the name of the complied file

## resolve

```
extensions: [".js", ".jsx", ".json", ".ts", ".tsx"],
```

Input file Types are the extensions in the array

## Module

```js
 module: {
 rules: [
            {
 test: /\.(ts|tsx)$/,
 loader: "awesome-typescript-loader",
            },
            {
 enforce: "pre",
 test: /\.js$/,
 loader: "source-map-loader",
            },
        ],
    },
};
```

The module rules contain the loaders which actually compile your script. You can
install these with npm

You will need a tsconfig.json file for handling typescript

Activation In the package.json file of your script your can set the activation
commands for webpack

```json
 "scripts": {
    "dev": "webpack --mode development --watch",
    "build": "webpack --mode production"
  },
```

`npm run dev` will run the dev build and compile your scripts

`npm run` build will make a optimized production build

You can create package.json with npm init -y in terminal
