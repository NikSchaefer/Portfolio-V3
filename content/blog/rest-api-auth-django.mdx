## Prerequisites :

understanding of python Basic understanding of django

## What is a Rest API?

As opposed to a graphQL api rest api have remained the preferred api method. On
a basic understanding a rest api a website will send a request to a url for
their server. The request will return the data needed.

## Using auth services

If you are in a rush to build a project using a auth service such as auth0 it
can be more efficient but it is often expensive when you can just build your own
auth.

## setting up a rest api

### POST Requests

The primary way for websites to send data is through a post request. The website
will send a json formatted data to a server url in which the server will handle
and return a response accordingly.

### Django's built in User Model

Django comes with a built in user model that automatically encodes passwords and
handles harder things for you. you can import this from

```py
from django.contrib.auth
```

### handling a post request with django

to handle a request you need to create a view and attach a url.

#### create user example

```py
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from django.contrib.auth import authenticate
from rest_framework import status
from rest_framework.decorators import api_view
from rest_framework.response import Response

def username_exists(username):
 if User.objects.filter(username=username).exists():
 return True

 return False

@api_view(['POST'])
def createUserView(request):
    print(request.user)
    username = request.data["username"]
    email= request.data["email"]
    password = request.data["password"]

    if username_exists(username):
        return Response("User Exists")
    if len(list(username)) < 6:
        return Response("Requires Longer Username")
    if len(list(password)) < 6:
        return Response("Requires Longer Password")
    user = User.objects.create_user(
username=username, email=email, password=password)

    created_user = user.get_username(user)
    return Response(created_user, "account Created")
```

In urls.py

```py
from django.urls import path

urlpatterns = [
 path("create", createUserView),
]
```

Now Sending a post request to api/create, this view is attached to will create a
user in django if the username and password is longer than 6 characters and no
one has that username

From this post request example you can see how to handle a post request a then
take action accordingly. from this you can look at django documentation on the
functions to login, auth, delete and more.
